## ðŸ”„ User Flow

### New User Journey:

### Subscription Data Structure:
```javascript
{
  plan: 'standard',           // basic, standard, premium
  price: 5.99,               // Monthly price
  startDate: '2024-01-15',   // Subscription start
  nextBilling: '2024-12-15', // Next billing date
  status: 'active'           // active, cancelled, expired
}
```
